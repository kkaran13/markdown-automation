# Deployment Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides standard deployment guidelines for all repositories in our organization. It is automatically updated across all repositories to maintain consistency.

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites
- Ensure all tests pass in the CI pipeline
- Code review has been completed and approved
- Version number has been updated according to semantic versioning

### Deployment Steps
1. Create a release branch from develop: `git checkout -b release/vX.X.X develop`
2. Run final tests: `npm test` or `pytest`
3. Update version numbers in appropriate files
4. Commit version changes: `git commit -am "Bump version to X.X.X"`
5. Merge to main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff release/vX.X.X
   git tag -a vX.X.X -m "Version X.X.X"
   ```
6. Push changes and tags: `git push && git push --tags`
7. Deploy to production using the CI/CD pipeline

## Post-Deployment
- Monitor application metrics for any anomalies
- Verify that all features are working as expected
- Update the changelog and release notes

## Rollback Procedure
If issues are detected in the production environment:

1. Identify the source of the problem
2. Decide whether to fix forward or rollback
3. If rolling back:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git revert [problematic commit]
   git push
   ```
4. Deploy the previous stable version
